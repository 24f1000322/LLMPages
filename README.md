# LLMPages: AI-Generated Content Showcase

This project, "LLMPages," is a complete single-page web application (SPA) designed to showcase various types of content generated by an AI. It fulfills the requirements of the LLMPages task by embedding most of the required "files" directly within the `index.html` using data URIs, while `LICENSE` and `uid.txt` are provided as standalone files for direct access as well. This architecture results in a self-contained and easily deployable static website, ideal for platforms like GitHub Pages.

## Project Summary

The LLMPages application presents a dynamic and interactive interface to explore several distinct pieces of content: a creative short story, an ethical dilemma, a self-description in Markdown, a custom SVG illustration, a local restaurant recommendation, and an economic prediction. Each piece of content is instantly accessible through a navigation menu, maintaining the single-page experience.
